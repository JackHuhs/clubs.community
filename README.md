# clubs.community
A platform to make finding clubs easier.

## Current Features:
1. View clubs, and display a popup for them when clicked
2. Search for clubs, and filter them by category
3. Links to other resources for making the club experience better!

<hr />

# Run Locally:
**1. Clone the project:**

```
git clone https://github.com/RCubed6/clubs.community.git
```

**2. In the `clubs.commmunity` folder, install dependencies:**

```
npm i
```

**3. Run the front-end and back-end:**

**Important:** You must start the backend before running the frontend!

In the project directory, open the `clubs.community/api` folder, then run `npm start`:

```
cd api
npm start
```

This will run the front-end in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in your browser.

This page will reload when any changes are made to the `clubs.community/api` folder.
You may also see any lint warnings in the console. These are not fatal errors.

Next navigate to the global directory `clubs.community`, and run:

```
npm start
```

This runs the frontend. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

Both the backend and frontend need to be running for clubs to populate the website.

# Future Features:

1. Integration to join clubs, create clubs, and/or request funding within the app.
2. Authentication system, so only Nueva students can access club info.
3. Ways for club leaders to dynamically interact with members in the app, such as sending emails or a forum

# Getting Started with React

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
